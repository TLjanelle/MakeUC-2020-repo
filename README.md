## SpaceX Launches, Maritime Ships, and Mythology  

MakeUC 2020 inspired four young Eastern Michigan University students to participate in their first hackathon together. These students were previously complete strangers with a diverse set of experience and skills. They efficiently came together from home during the COVID era to create, develop, and design a website in 24 hours. This website utilizes three languages, an api, Google Cloud, and Spring Boot to deliver SpaceX Launch and Landing Data, as well as the related mythology from past cultures.
